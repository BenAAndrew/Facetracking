# Facetracking - Raspberry Pi IoT System

# Introduction
This project is designed to cover the process of creating a simple processing system for IoT solutions, and how to create a real time face tracking system. 

The end goal of this was to take an Inmoov head (http://inmoov.fr/head-3/) and make it watch people in real time by tracking their face and moving servos to fix on their face (a bit creepy but why not).

To make this possible I used a <b>Raspberry pi</b> with a camera mounted inside the head which will then stream this to an <b>external pc</b> (a concept ideal for IoT problems)
